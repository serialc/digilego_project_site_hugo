Digilego is hosting a virtual ﬁeld course
development workshop in the Burren Nature
Sanctuary in near Galway, Ireland, from **June 28th – 30th 2022**.

The aim is to **develop a series of open educa-
tional resources** that each have use and value
in their own right but also as a larger-scale
resource that can be used as a ﬁeld session/ﬁeld
day in an entirely online capacity. **Participants
will also learn how to create virtual ﬁeld
trips and resources.**

Training will be provided on the development of
virtual ﬁeld trips and will include:

- outdoor video capture
- video processing and basic editing, and
- use of H5P to create open educational resources.

The workshop will focus on ecology, particularly
plant ecology, but will also aim to include
elements of soil science, zoology, tourism and
archaeology.

The workshop will be located in the Burren
Nature Sanctuary (BNS), which is on the edge of
the Burren near a small sea-side town called
Kinvara. The BNS is a conservation area
dedicated to the Burren. Within its 25 acres are a
range of diﬀerent habitats including a low-
nutrient grassland, woodland and turlough. The
sanctuary also has some animals and is a
popular local tourist destination. You can read

We are interested in bringing a diverse group of
people together to work at creating what will be
a valuable resource and, although the weather
cannot be guaranteed, the Burren and Kinvara
are both beautiful places to visit.

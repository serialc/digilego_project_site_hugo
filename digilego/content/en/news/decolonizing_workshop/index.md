## Let's talk about (de)colonial learning

Interested in teaching and learning in higher education? This workshop will provide you with an introduction to perspectives that allow you to critically think about power dynamics and assumptions in knowledge creation and learning. It will focus on how we can decolonialize our (digital) classroom.

## Travel to the Trier-Luxembourg region

For international travel (by air) the airport in Luxembourg is the closest and most convenient. Despite public transport being free in Luxembourg you **must buy a ticket** as you are crossing the border (it's only a few Euros).

It has multiple bus connection to Trier:
- Direct with [Bus 302](https://www.mobiliteit.lu/wp-content/uploads/horaires-new/rgtr/302.pdf) (**Monday to Friday** only)
- Two buses [Bus 16](https://www.mobiliteit.lu/wp-content/uploads/horaires-new/avl/16.pdf) to LuxExpo then [Bus 303](https://www.mobiliteit.lu/wp-content/uploads/horaires-new/rgtr/303.pdf)
- Bus to Luxembourg and then taking the bus.

Other airports exist in the region (e.g., Frankfürt Hahn, Frankfürt) but will require longer train or bus rides.

**Local transportation**:

Public transport is free in Luxembourg. If you travel from Luxembourg to Trier or back, you are required to purchase a bus or train ticket for the German part of the trip. Bus tickets can be purchased on the bus, train tickets should be purchased prior to boarding the train.

### Hotels

There are a variety of hotels in Trier and Belval available.


#### Trier

There are plenty of accomodation options in Trier. The following are only a few minutes away from the historic Porta Nigra where busses to the University and to Luxembourg depart from.

- [Paulin Hotel Trier](https://www.hotel-paulin-trier.de/)  
- [Hotel Porta Nigra](https://www.hotel-porta-nigra.de/)  
- [Mercure Hotel Trier Porta Nigra](https://all.accor.com/hotel/5356/index.de.shtml?utm_campaign=seo+maps&utm_medium=seo+maps&utm_source=google+Maps)

#### Luxembourg

You can either choose an accommodation in **Luxembourg City** which provides easy access to the airport or in **Esch-sur-Alzette** *closer* to the workshop venue.
LISER is in **Belval**, also called Belval-Université or Esch-Belval, but not to be confused with the adjacent train station and larger city of **Esch-sur-Alzette**.

If you opt for Luxembourg City, you might want to look for an option in proximity to the train station (the Gare district) to access public transport to Esch-Belval (train station Belval-Université) and Findel Airport. 

The closest hotel next to LISER (and the University of Luxembourg) is the [ibis Esch Belval](https://all.accor.com/ssr/app/ibis/hotels/esch-sur-alzette-luxembourg/index.fr.shtml?).
It is best option if you don't want to worry about getting to the venue which is only a few hundred meters away, but is perhaps not the most interesting part of Luxembourg.

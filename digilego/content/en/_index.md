# Developing methodology resources

The digilego project focuses on the development and provisionment of methodology resources (using an online portal currently under development) in geography and environmental science within the following domains.

### Field
We will train a new cohort of university teaching staff how to create and deliver virtual and blended field trips, produce high-quality virtual field trips, and produce a series of building blocks, manuals and how-to guides that will facilitate the creation of targeted resources by university teaching staff.

### Quantitative
Spatial and temporal analysis, principles of sampling, properties of data and measurement, presentation of data via graphs, plots and maps, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and a wide range of terminology and concepts related to surveying, mapping, data handling, descriptive and inferential statistics and critical appraisal of quantitative results.

### Qualitative
Methods resources will cover standard social science methods such as interviews, focus groups, archive methods, textual analysis, visual representations, and central themes related to research contexts such as decolonizing the curriculum, positionality, and research ethics.

### Lab 
Lab methodology resources will facilitate analysis training of diverse topics, such as: water and sediment, stereoscopic aerial photography, and field surveying and data gathering. We will be generating a mixture of OERs including videos, images, unpublished datasets, editable and fixed documentation covering lab methods from aspects of lab safety and set up to analytical aspects.
